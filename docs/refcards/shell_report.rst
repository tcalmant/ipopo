Shell reports
#############

Pelix/iPOPO comes with a bundle, ``pelix.shell.report``, which provides
commands to generate reports describing the current framework and its host.
This main purpose of this feature is to debug a faulty framework by grabbing
all available information.
It can also be used to have a quick overview of the operating system, either
to check the installation environment or to identify the host machine.

Setup
=====

This feature requires an active Pelix Shell (``pelix.shell.core``) and a UI.
See :ref:`refcard_shell` for more information on this subject.
The iPOPO service is not required for this feature to work.

It can therefore be started programmatically using the following snippet:

.. code-block:: python

    # Start the framework, with the required bundles and the report bundle
    framework = create_framework(
        ["pelix.shell.core", "pelix.shell.report"])

    # ... or install & start it using the BundleContext
    bundle_context.install_bundle("pelix.shell.report").start()

It can only be installed from a Shell UI using the command
``start pelix.shell.report``.

Usage
=====

The bundle provides the following commands in the ``report`` namespace:

======================= =======================================================
Command                 Description
======================= =======================================================
``clear``               Clears the last report
``levels``              Lists the available levels of reporting
``make [<levels ...>]`` Prepares a report with the indicated levels (all levels if none set)
``show [<levels ...>]`` Shows the latest report. Prepares it if levels have been indicated
``write <filename>``    Write the latest report as a JSON file
======================= =======================================================

Report levels
=============

The reports are made of multiple "level information" sections.
They describe the current state of the application and its environment.

Here are some of the available levels.

Framework information
---------------------

=================== ===========================================================
Level               Description
=================== ===========================================================
``pelix_basic``     Framework properties and version
``pelix_bundles``   Bundles ID, name, version, state and location
``pelix_services``  Services ID, bundle and properties
``ipopo_factories`` Description of iPOPO factories (with their bundle)
``ipopo_instances`` Details of iPOPO instances
=================== ===========================================================

Process information
--------------------

=========== ===================================================================
Level       Description
=========== ===================================================================
``process`` Details about the current process (PID, user, working directory, ...)
``threads`` Lists the current process threads and their stacktrace
=========== ===================================================================

Python information
-------------------

================== ============================================================
Level              Description
================== ============================================================
``python``         Python interpreter details (version, compiler, path, ...)
``python_modules`` Lists all Python modules imported by the application
``python_path``    Lists the content of the Python Path
================== ============================================================

Host information
----------------

=========== ===================================================================
Level       Description
=========== ===================================================================
``os``      Details about the OS (version, architecture, CPUs, ...) and the host name
``os_env``  Lists the environment variables and their value
``network`` Lists the IPs (v4 and v6) of the host, its name and FQDN.
=========== ===================================================================

Group levels
------------

Some levels are groups of lower levels. They are subject to change, therefore
the following table is given as an indication.
Always refer to the ``report.levels`` shell command to check available ones.

============ ==================================================================
Level        Description
============ ==================================================================
``pelix``    Combines ``pelix_infos``, ``pelix_bundles`` and ``pelix_services``
``ipopo``    Combines ``ipopo_factories`` and ``ipopo_instances``
``app``      Combines ``os``, ``os_env``, ``process``, ``python`` and ``python_path``
``debug``    Combines ``app`` (except ``os_env``), ``pelix``, ``ipopo`` and ``python_modules``
``standard`` Like ``debug``, but without ``pelix_services`` nor ``ipopo_instances``
``full``     Combines ``debug``, ``os_env``, ``network`` and ``threads``
============ ==================================================================

Those *groups* were defined according to the most common combinations of levels
used during iPOPO development and live setup.
