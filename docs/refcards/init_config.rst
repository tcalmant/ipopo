Initial Configuration File
==========================

The ``pelix.misc.init_handler`` module provides the :class:`~InitFileHandler`
class.
It is able to load the configuration of an iPOPO framework, from one or
multiple files.

This configuration allows to setup environment variables, additional Python
paths, framework properties, a list of bundles to start with the framework
and a list of components to instantiate.


File Format
-----------

Configuration files are in JSON format, with a root object which can contain
the following entries:

* ``properties``: a JSON object defining the initial properties of the
  framework. The object keys must be strings, but can be associated to any
  valid JSON value.
* ``environment``: a JSON object defining new environment variables for the
  process running the framework. Both keys and values must be strings.
* ``paths``: a JSON array containing paths to add to the Python lookup paths.
  The given paths will be prioritized, *i.e.* if a path was already defined in
  ``sys.path``, it will be moved forward.
  The given paths can contains environment variables and the user path marker
  (``~``).

  Note that the current working directory (*cwd*) will always be the first
  element of ``sys.path`` when using an initial configuration handler.
* ``bundles``: a JSON array containing the names of the bundles to install and
  start with the framework.
* ``components``: a JSON array of JSON objects defining the components to
  instantiate. Each component description has the following entries:

  * ``factory``: the name of the component factory
  * ``name``: the name of the instance
  * ``properties`` (optional): a JSON object defining the initial properties of
    the component

.. note::

   The ``components`` entry requires iPOPO to work.
   Therefore, the ``pelix.ipopo.core`` bundle must be declared in the
   ``bundles`` entry of the initial configuration file.

Here is a sample initial configuration file:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "properties": {
       "some.value": 42,
       "framework.uuid": "custom-uuid",
       "arrays": ["they", "work", "too", 123],
       "dicts": {"why": "not?"}
     },
     "environment": {
       "new_path": "/opt/foo",
       "LANG": "en_US.UTF-8"
     },
     "paths": [
       "/opt/bar",
       "$new_path/mylib.zip"
     ],
     "bundles": [
       "pelix.ipopo.core",
       "pelix.misc.log",
       "pelix.shell.log",
       "pelix.http.basic"
     ],
     "components": [
       {
         "factory": "pelix.http.service.basic.factory",
         "name": "httpd",
         "properties": {
            "pelix.http.address": "127.0.0.1"
         }
       }
     ]
   }


Configuration override
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The initial configuration can be split in multiple files in order to ease
the specialisation of frameworks sharing a common base configuration.
This is explained in the following `File Lookup`_ section.

Sometimes, it can be necessary to redefine some entries, *e.g* in order to
change a set of components but keeping the bundles to be started.
If the root object contains a ``reset_<name>`` entry, then the
previously loaded configuration for the ``<name>`` entry are forgotten: the
current configuration will replace the old one instead of updating it.

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "bundles": [
        "pelix.ipopo.core",
        "pelix.http.basic"
     ],
     "reset_bundles": true
   }

When this file will be loaded, the list of bundles declared by previously loaded
configuration files will be cleared and replaced by the one in this file.

.. _init_conf_lookup:

File lookup
-----------

An :class:`~InitFileHandler` object updates its internal state with the content
of the files it parses.
As a result, multiple configuration files can be used to start framework with
a common basic configuration.

When calling :meth:`~InitFileHandler.load` without argument, the handler will
try to load all the files named ``.pelix.conf`` in the following folders and
order:

* ``/etc/default``
* ``/etc``
* ``/usr/local/etc``
* ``~/.local/pelix``
* ``~/.config``
* ``~`` (user directory)
* ``.`` (current working directory)

When giving a file name to :meth:`~InitFileHandler.load`, the handler will
merge the newly loaded configuration with the current state of the handler.

Finally, after having updated a configuration, the :class:`~InitFileHandler`
will remove the duplicated elements of the Python path and bundles entries.


Support in Pelix shell
----------------------

The framework doesn't start a :class:`~InitFileHandler` on its own: the handler
must be created and loaded before creating the framework.

Currently, all the Pelix Shell interfaces (local console, remote shell and XMPP)
support the initial configuration, using the following arguments:

* *no argument*: the `.pelix.conf` files are loaded as described in
  :ref:`init_conf_lookup`.
* ``-e``, ``--empty-conf``: no initial configuration file will be loaded
* ``-c <filename>``, ``--conf <filename>``: the default configuration files,
  then given one will be loaded.
* ``-C <filename>``, ``--exclusive-conf <filename>``: only the given
  configuration file will be loaded.


API
---

.. autoclass:: InitFileHandler
   :members: clear, load, normalize, instantiate_components, bundles,
             properties

.. module:: pelix.shell.console

Note that the ``pelix.shell.console`` module provides a
:meth:`~handle_common_arguments` method to automate the use of an
initial configuration with the arguments common to all Pelix Shell scripts:

.. autofunction:: handle_common_arguments

Sample API Usage
----------------

This sample starts a framework based on the default configuration files
(see `File lookup`_), plus a given one named *some_file.json*.

.. code-block:: python

    import pelix.framework as pelix
    from pelix.misc.init_handler import InitFileHandler

    # Read the initial configuration script
    init = InitFileHandler()

    # Load default configuration
    init.load()

    # Load the given configuration file
    init.load("some_file.json")

    # Normalize configuration (forge sys.path)
    init.normalize()

    # Use the utility method to create, run and delete the framework
    framework = pelix.create_framework(init.bundles, init.properties)
    framework.start()

    # Instantiate configured components
    init.instantiate_components(framework.get_bundle_context())

    # Let the framework live
    try:
        framework.wait_for_stop()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        framework.stop()
