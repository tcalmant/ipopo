Name of the module member that will be used as bundle activator.

* start(BundleContext)

Property containing the list of specifications (strings) provided by a service

Property containing the ID of a service.
This ID is unique in a framework instance.
"""

SERVICE_BUNDLEID = "service.bundleid"
"""
Property containing the ID of the bundle providing the service.
"""

SERVICE_PID = 'service.pid'
"""
Property containing the Persistent ID of a service, i.e. a string identifier
that will always be the same for a (kind of) service, even after restarting
the framework.
This is used by the Configuration Admin to bind managed services and
configurations.
"""

SERVICE_RANKING = "service.ranking"
"""
Property that indicates the ranking of a service. It is used to sort the
results of methods like get_service_references()
"""

SERVICE_SCOPE = "service.scope"
"""
Property that indicates the service's scope, one of "singleton", "bundle" or
"prototype".
This allows the framework to detect service factories and prototype service
factories.
"""

FRAMEWORK_UID = "framework.uid"
"""
Framework instance "unique" identifier. Used in Remote Services to identify
a framework from another.
It can be generated or be forced using the framework initialization properties.
This property is constant during the life of a framework instance.

OSGi standard framework uuid property name.   Set in framework init to the value
of FRAMEWORK_UID

SCOPE_SINGLETON = "singleton"

Default service scope: the service is a singleton, which means that the service
object is shared by all bundles

SCOPE_BUNDLE = "bundle"
"""
Service factory scope: the service factory is called each time a new bundle
requires the service.
Each service can have its own version of the service, but will get the same
version if it calls ``get_service()`` multiple times.
"""

SCOPE_PROTOTYPE = "prototype"
"""
Prototype service factory scope: the factory is called each time the caller
gets the service.
This allows all bundles to have multiples objects for the same service.
